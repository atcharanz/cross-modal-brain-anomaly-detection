# Cross-Modal Brain Anomaly Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on **unsupervised brain anomaly detection using cross-modal medical imaging** (MRI and CT).
The goal is to learn **normal anatomical structure representations** and detect anomalies through **reconstruction error and latent-space inconsistency**.

This approach is useful when **annotated medical anomaly datasets are limited or unavailable**.

---

## Problem Statement

Medical anomaly detection often suffers from:

* Lack of labeled anomaly data
* High variability in imaging modalities
* Domain differences between MRI and CT

This project explores **cross-modal reconstruction learning** to detect abnormal regions without explicit anomaly labels.

---

## Approach

The system uses:

* Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)
* Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
* Cross-modal reconstruction
* Reconstruction-error anomaly maps

Pipeline:

```
MRI/CT Input
     ↓
Encoder
     ↓
Latent Representation
     ↓
Decoder
     ↓
Reconstruction
     ↓
Error Map → Anomaly Detection
```

Place datasets locally in:

```
datasets/
```

Example structure:

```
datasets/
├── MRI/
└── CT/
```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atcharanz/cross-modal-brain-anomaly-detection.git
cd cross-modal-brain-anomaly-detection
```



## Evaluation

Anomalies are detected using:

* Reconstruction loss
* Latent space deviation

Example visualization:

```

## Key Ideas

This project demonstrates:

* Unsupervised anomaly detection
* Representation learning in medical imaging
* Cross-modal consistency learning
* Autoencoder-based anomaly localization
